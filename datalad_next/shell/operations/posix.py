    This function uploads a file to the connected shell ``shell``. It uses

    The requirements for upload are:

    Parameters
    ----------
    shell : ShellCommandExecutor
        The shell that should be used to upload the file.
    local_path : Path
        The file that should be uploaded.
    remote_path : PurePosixPath

    progress_callback : callable[[int, int], None], optional, default: None

    This method downloads a file from the connected shell. It uses ``base64`` in
    the shell to encode the file. The encoding is mainly done to ensure that the
    end-marker is significant, i.e. not contained in the transferred file
    content, and to ensure that no control-sequences are sent.

    The requirements for download via instances of class
    :class:`DownloadResponseGeneratorPosix` are:
    - The connected shell must support `stat -c`.
    - The connected shell must support `echo -e`.
    - The connected shell must support `cat`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shell: ShellCommandExecutor
        The shell from which a file should be downloaded.
    remote_path : PurePosixPath
        The name of the file on the connected shell that should be
        downloaded.
    local_path : Path
        The name of the local file that will contain the downloaded content.
    response_generator_class : type[DownloadResponseGenerator], optional, default: DownloadResponseGeneratorPosix
        The response generator that should be used to handle the download
        output. It must be a subclass of :class:`DownloadResponseGenerator`.
        The default works if the connected shell runs on a ``Linux`` system.
        On ``OSX`` systems, the response generator should be
        :class:`DownloadResponseGeneratorOSX`. The two classes only differ in
