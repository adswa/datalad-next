### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Patch `create_sibling_gitlab` to work with present day GitLab deployments.
  This required adjusting the naming scheme for the `flat` and `collection`
  layouts. Moreover, the `hierarchy` layout is removed. it has never been
  fully implemented, and conceptually suffers from various corner-cases
  that cannot be (easily) addressed. Consequently, the `collection` layout
  is the new default. It's behavior matches that of `hierarchy` as far as this
  was functional, hence there should be no breakage for active users.
