### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- A rewrite of `SSHRemoteIO`, the RIA SSH-operations implementation from
  datalad-core is provided as a patch. It is based on the new `shell`
  feature, and provides more robust operations. It's IO performance is
  at the same level as `scp`-based down/uploads. In contrast to the
  original implementation, it support fine-grained progress reporting
  for uploads and downloads.

- The `SpecialRemote` base class in datalad-core is patched to support
  a standard `close()` method for implementing resource release and cleanup
  operations. The main special remote entrypoint has been altered to
  run implementations within a `closing()` context manager to guarantee
  execution of such handlers.
