### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- Commands can now opt-in to receive fully validated parameters. This can
  substantially simplify the implementation complexity of a command at
  the expense of a more elaborate specification of the structural and
  semantic properties of the parameters. This specification is achieved
  by declaring `Constraints`, in a `_validators_` member of a commands
  `Interface` class.

  For now, a corresponding `Interface.validate_args()` classmethod must also
  be provided that performs the validation, and returns the validated outcomes.
  In the future a common implementation of this method will likely be
  provided that will define additional common conventions re parameter
  validation order, and accessibility of previous validation results to
  subsequent validation attempts of other parameters.

  This feature is introduced as a patch to the command execution in
  datalad-core. With this patch, commands are now exclusively called
  with keyword-style parameters only.

- A new `EnsureDataset` constraint is provided that returns a
  `DatasetParameter` on successful validation. This return value contains
  the original input specification, and the `Dataset` class instance.
  The `resolve_path()` utility is adjust to support this parameter-type,
  thereby making the use of the `require_dataset()` utility obsolete.
