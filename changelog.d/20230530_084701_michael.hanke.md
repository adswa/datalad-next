### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Patch `CommandError`, the standard exception raised for any non-zero exit
  command execution to now reports which command failed with `repr()` too.
  Previously, only `str()` would produce an informative message about a failure,
  while `repr()` would report `CommandError('')`, unless a dedicated message was
  provided. (by @mih)
