### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- `CredentialManager.get()` and the `credentials` command now also report
  credential fragments for which there is no secret on record. This enables
  the discovery of DataLad's legacy credentials, and for setting a secret
  for them for use with the next credential system. Moreover, it reports
  half-configured credentials, and facilitates their clean-up or completion,
  for example with DataLad Gooey's credential management GUI.
