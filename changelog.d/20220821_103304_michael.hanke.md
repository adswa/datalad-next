### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- The default of the configuration item `datalad.annex.retry`
  (in effect when not explicitly configured otherwise) is changed
  from `3` to `1`. This prevents a set of performance and user experience
  issues resulting from, e.g., repeated download attempts, even
  when no change in outcome can be expected (e.g., a wrong or
  no credential supplied). This change can cause a loss of robustness
  in download behavior for services that indeed experience spurious
  failures. Its is recommended to specifically parametrize such command
  calls (e.g., downloads in CI runs) with an appropriate configuration
  override.
