### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- New `tree` command for traversing a directory hierarchy.
  Like the UNIX equivalent, it can visualize a directory tree.
  Additionally, it annotates the output with DataLad-related
  information, like the location of dataset, and their nesting
  depth. Besides visualization, `tree` also reports structured
  data in the form of result records that enable other applications
  to use `tree` for gathering data from the file system.
