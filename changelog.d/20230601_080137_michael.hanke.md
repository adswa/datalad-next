### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Some error messages (in particular from within git-annex special remotes)
  exhibited uninformative error messages like `CommandError('')`. This
  is now fixed by letting `CommandError` produce the same error rendering
  in `__str__` and `__repr__`. Previously, `RuntimeError.__repr__` was used,
  which was unaware of command execution details also available in the exception.
