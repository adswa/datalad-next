### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- Dedicated dataclasses for common types, such as git-annex keys (`AnnexKey`)
  and `dl+archives:` URLs (`ArchivistLocator`) have been added. They support
  parsing and rendering their respective plain-text representations. These new
  types are now also available for more precise type annotation and argument
  validation. (by @mih)
