### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- Code organization is adjusted to clearly indicate what is part of the
  package's public Python API. Anything that can be imported directly from
  the top-level of any sub-package is part of the public API.
  As an example: `from datalad_next.runners import iter_git_subproc`
  imports a   part of the public API, but
  `from datalad_next.runners.git import iter_git_subproc` does not.
  See `README.md` for more information.
