### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `next-status -r mono` now reports on new commits in submodules.
  Previously this was ignored, leading to the impression of
  clean datasets despite unsaved changes.

### 💫 Enhancements and new features

- `next-status` and `iter_gitstatus()` have been improved to
  report on further modifications after a file addition has been
  originally staged.

- `next-status` result rendering has been updated to be more markedly
  different than git-status's. Coloring is now exclusively
  determined by the nature of a change, rather than being partially
  similar to git-status's index-updated annotation. This reduces
  the chance for misinterpretations, and does not create an undesirable
  focus on the Git index (which is largely ignored by DataLad).
