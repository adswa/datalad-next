### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- New `datalad_next.iter_collections` module providing iterators for
  items in particular collections, such as TAR or ZIP archives members,
  or content of a file system directory. Iterators yield items of
  defined types that typically carry information on the properties
  of collections items, and (in the case of files) access to their
  content.
- New command `ls_file_collection()` is providing access to a select set
  of collection iterators via the DataLad command. In addition to the
  plain iterators, it provide uniform content hashing across all
  supported collection types.
