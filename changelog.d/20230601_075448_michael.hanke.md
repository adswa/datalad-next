### 🏠 Internal

- The patch registry has been moved to `datalad_next.patches.enabled`,
  and the `apply_patch()` helper is now located in `datalad_next.patches`
  directly to avoid issues with circular dependencies when patching
  core components like the `ConfigManager`. The documentation on patching
  has been adjusted accordingly.
