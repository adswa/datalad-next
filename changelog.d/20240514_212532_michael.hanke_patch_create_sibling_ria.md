### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- A large 3k-line patch set replaces almost the entire RIA implementation,
  including the ORA special remote, and the `create-sibling-ria` command.
  The new implementation brings uniform support for Windows clients, progress
  reporting for uploads and downloads via SSH, and a faster and more
  robust behavior for SSH-based operations (based on the new remote
  shell feature).
