### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- As a companion of `LeanGitRepo` a `LeanAnnexRepo` has been added.  This class
  is primarily used to signal that particular code does not require the full
  `AnnexRepo` API, but works with a much reduced API, as defined by that class.
  The API definition is not final and will grow in future releases to accommodate
  all standard use cases.  https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/387
