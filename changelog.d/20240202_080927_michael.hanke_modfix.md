### ðŸ›¡ Tests

- Promote a previously internal fixture to provide a standard
  `modified_dataset` fixture. This fixture is sessions-scope, and
  yields a dataset with many facets of modification, suitable for
  testing change reporting. The fixture verifies that no
  modifications have been applied to the testbed. (by @mih)
