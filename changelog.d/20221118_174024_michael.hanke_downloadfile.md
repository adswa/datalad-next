### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- A new `download` command aims to replace any download-related functionality
  in DataLad. It supports single-pass checksumming, progress reporting for
  any supported URL scheme. Currently support schemes are `http(s)://`,
  `file://`, and `ssh://`. The new command integrates with the `datalad-next`
  credential system, and supports auto-discovery, interactive-prompt-on-demand,
  and (optional) save-on-success of credentials.
  Additional URL scheme handlers can be provided by extension packages. Unlike
  the datalad-core downloaders framework, they can be fully standalone, as long
  as they implement a lean adaptor class (see `datalad_next.url_operations`).

- As a companion for the `http(s)://` URL handling for the new `download`
  command, a `requests`-compatible authentication handler has been implemented
  that integrates with the `datalad-next` credential system.
