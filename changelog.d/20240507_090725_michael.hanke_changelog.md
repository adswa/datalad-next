### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- `datalad_next.shell` provides a context manager for (long-running)
  shell or interpreter subprocesses. Within the context any number of
  commands can be executed in such a shell, and each command can
  process input (iterables), and yield output (iterables). This feature
  is suitable for running and controlling "remote shells" like a login
  shell on a server via SSH. A range of utilities is provided to
  employ this functionality for special purpose implementations
  (e.g., accept fixed-length or variable-length process output).
  A suite of operations like download/upload file to a remote shell is
  provided for POSIX-compliant shells `datalad_next.shell.operations.posix`.
