### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `iter_annexworktree()` can now also be used on plain Git repos,
  and would behave exactly as if reporting on non-annexed files
  in a git-annex repo. Previously, a cryptic `iterable did not yield
  matching item for route-in item, cardinality mismatch?` error was
  issued in this case.

### 💫 Enhancements and new features

- A new `has_initialized_annex()` helper function is provided to
  test for a locally initialized annex in a repo.
