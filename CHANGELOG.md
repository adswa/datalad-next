# 0.6.0 (2022-08-25)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed datalad-push always reporting success when pushing to
  an export remote.
  Fixes https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/issues/88 via
  https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/93 (by @bpoldrack)

- Token secrets entered for GitHub-like sibling creation are now stored by
  default under a name matching the API endpoint hostname (e.g.
  'api.github.com'), rather than a confusing and conflict-prone 'None'.
  Using the `--credential` option, an alternative name can be given, as before.

  https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/98 (by @mih)

## üí´ Enhancements and new features

- The `configuration` command now indicates the absence of a particular
  configuration setting queried via `get` with a `status='impossible'`
  result. This change enables the distinction of an unset configuration
  item from an item set to an empty string with the default
  CLI result renderer.
  Fixes https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6851 via
  https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/87 by @mih

- The default of the configuration item `datalad.annex.retry`
  (in effect when not explicitly configured otherwise) is changed
  from `3` to `1`. This prevents a set of performance and user experience
  issues resulting from, e.g., repeated download attempts, even
  when no change in outcome can be expected (e.g., a wrong or
  no credential supplied). This change can cause a loss of robustness
  in download behavior for services that indeed experience spurious
  failures. Its is recommended to specifically parametrize such command
  calls (e.g., downloads in CI runs) with an appropriate configuration
  override.
  Fixes https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6969 and
  https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6509 (by @mih)

- New `tree` command for traversing a directory hierarchy.
  Like the UNIX equivalent, it can visualize a directory tree.
  Additionally, it annotates the output with DataLad-related
  information, like the location of dataset, and their nesting
  depth. Besides visualization, `tree` also reports structured
  data in the form of result records that enable other applications
  to use `tree` for gathering data from the file system.
  Fixes https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/issues/78 via
  https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/92 (by @catetrai)

## üìù Documentation

- Add an example of adding a `user_password`-type credentials, with a
  given `user` property, to the examples in the `credentials`
  command. https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/103 (by @mslw)

# 0.5.0 (2022-07-19)

## üí´ Enhancements and new features

- The `configuration` command no longer requires a datasets to be present
  for a `get` operation to retrieve a configuration item from scope `global`.
  Fixes [#6864](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6854) via
  [#86](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/86) (by @mih)

# 0.4.1 (2022-07-14)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fix a missing import in the credential retrieval for GitHub-like sibling
  creation, which made it impossible to discover credentials without
  providing an explicit credential name.

# 0.4.0 (2022-07-08) --  datalad-annex:: for all

#### üí´ Enhancements and new features

- `datalad-annex::` Git remote helper now uses `git annex transferkey` instead
  of `fsck` to "probe" for `XDLRA` repository keys. This avoid problems due to
  a behavior change in git-annex 10.20220525, and can also speed-up operation for
  slow special remotes, by avoiding a dedicated probe-request.
  [#76](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/76) (by @mih)
- `datalad-annex::` Git remote helper now fully compatible with the Windows
  platform, by working around [a git-annex
  issue](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Fails_to_drop_key_on_windows___40__Access_denied__41__)
  [#77](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/77) (by @mih)

#### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Prevent docstring duplication in patched `push` command
  [#71](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/71) (by @mih)

#### üìù Documentation

- Bibliographic information on authorship was added
  [#80](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/80) (by @mslw)

#### üõ° Tests

- The test battery is now using `pytest`. This change required bumping the
  dependency on DataLad to version 0.17.0.
  [#73](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/73) (by @mih)

#### üè† Internal

- Reduced code duplication by consolidating on a common helper for sibling
  identification, now available from DataLad 0.17.0

# 0.3.0 (2022-05-25) --  Optimized push

#### üí´ Enhancements and new features

- Make push avoid refspec handling for special remote push targets. See PR
  https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/pull/64 for details on the associated
  behavior changes that are introduced with this new patch.

# 0.2.2 (2022-04-29) --  More docs!

#### üìù Documentation

- Adjusted documentation of patched datalad-core commands now also shows
  properly in Python sessions.
- Extended the documentation on collaborative workflows with
  ``datalad-annex::``Git remotes and WebDAV siblings.

# 0.2.1 (2022-04-28) --  User experience

#### üí´ Enhancements and new features

- Disable auto-enabling of webdav storage remotes on clone. Datalad does not
  yet support the needed inspection to determine the necessary credentials
  automatically. Instead an explicit `datalad sibling enable` call is required.
  This is now also added to the documentation.
- Make sure that `create-sibling-webdav` does not ask users to input the
  internal `realm` property, when prompting for credentials.
- `CredentialManager` now displays more appropriate labels when prompting for a
  secret, e.g. `password` instead of `user_password`.

# 0.2.0 (2022-04-28) --  WebDAV

This release primarly brings the ability to store DataLad datasets on a WebDAV
server. This is done in a way that allows for cloning such dataset with
`datalad clone` from such a WebDAV server too. This feature enables
full-featured DataLad-based collaborative workflows on widely available cloud
storage systems, such as owncloud/next/cloud -- which are also the basis for
several institutional services like the European Open Science Cloud's (EOSC)
B2DROP service.

#### üí´ Enhancements and new features

- A `create-sibling-webdav` command for hosting datasets on a WebDAV server via
  a sibling tandem for Git history and file storage. Datasets hosted on WebDAV
  in this fashion are cloneable with `datalad-clone`. A full annex setup  for
  storing complete datasets with historical file content version, and an
  additional mode for depositing single-version dataset snapshot are supported.
  The latter enables convenient collaboration with audiences that are not using
  DataLad, because all files are browsable via a WebDAV server's point-and-click
  user interface.
- Enhance `datalad-push` to automatically export files to git-annex special
  remotes configured with `exporttree=yes`.
- Enhance `datalad-siblings enable` (`AnnexRepo.enable_remote()` to
  automatically  deploy credentials for git-annex special remotes that require
  them.
- `git-remote-datalad-annex` is a Git remote helper to push/fetch to any
  location accessible by any git-annex special remote.
- `git-annex-backend-XDLRA` (originally available from the `mihextras`
  extension) is a custom external git-annex backend used by
  git-remote-datalad-annex. A base class to facilitate development of external
  backends in Python is also provided.
- `serve_path_via_webdav` test decorator that automatically deploys a local
  WebDAV server.
- `with_credential` test decorator that temporarily deploy a credential to the
  local credential system.
- Utilities for HTTP handling
  - `probe_url()` to discover redirects and authentication requirements for an
    HTTP  URL
  - `get_auth_realm()` return a label for an authentication realm that can be
    used  to query for matching credentials


- Utilities for special remote credential management:
  - `get_specialremote_credential_properties()` inspects a special remote and
    return  properties for querying a credential store for matching credentials
  - `update_specialremote_credential()` updates a credential in a store after
    successful use
  - `get_specialremote_credential_envpatch()` returns a suitable environment
    "patch" from a credential for a particular special remote type

# 0.1.0 (2022-03-31) --  Credentials, please!

#### üí´ Enhancements and new features

- A new credential management system is introduced that enables storage and
  query of credentials with any number of properties associated with a secret.
  These properties are stored as regular configuration items, following the
  scheme `datalad.credential.<name>.<property>`. The special property `secret`
  lives in a keystore, but can be overriden using the normal configuration
  mechanisms. The new system continues to support the previous credential storage
  setup. Fixes [#6519](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6519)
  ([@mih](https://github.com/mih))
- A new `credentials` command enables query, modification and storage of
  credentials. Legacy credentials are also supported, but may require the
  specification of a `type`, such as (`token`, or `user_password`) to be
  discoverable. Fixes [#396](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/396)
  ([@mih](https://github.com/mih))
- Two new configuration settings enable controlling how the interactive entry
  of credential secrets is conducted for the new credential manager:
  `datalad.credentials.repeat-secret-entry` can be used to turn off the default
  double-entry of secrets, and `datalad.credentials.hidden-secret-entry` can turn
  off the default hidden entry of secrets. Fixes
